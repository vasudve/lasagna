    <p>I’m from a middle-class family from Kerala, I am Vasudev Subramaniam. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a computer engineer</p>

<p>My mother is a lecturer at a university. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.</p>

<p>I have a sister. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my sister. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings.I study in Our Own High School.I am in class 8. My sister studies in Gems Legacy School. Food is my passion.</p>

<p>I am artistic and a keen reader of comics and comedy books.  At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.</p>
